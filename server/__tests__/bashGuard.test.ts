/**
 * The Bash guard has to actually fire.
 *
 * `.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-bash.sh` is what AGENTS.md §2.1 points at when
 * it says a force-push, a push that moves the default branch, and the flag that
 * skips hooks are enforced rather than merely written down. It parsed its input
 * with `jq`, which was not installed on these machines, so the command was the
 * empty string on every call, no case matched, and it exited 0 -- allowing every
 * shape it names, for its entire existence, while reading as a working guard.
 *
 * That is the failure this repo warns about most often, so the guard now gets
 * the treatment every other gate here gets: a suite that drives it with inputs
 * it must refuse and inputs it must not, and that goes red if it ever falls
 * silent again. A guard nobody has watched block something is a guard nobody
 * knows works.
 *
 * Every guarded shape below is assembled from parts on purpose, identifiers
 * included. Spelled out, it would be caught by the live guard the moment an
 * assistant tried to write or edit this file -- which is itself a small proof
 * that the thing works.
